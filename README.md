# 🗃️ SQL Database Project

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for relational database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying. It reflects core skills in writing structured queries and understanding normalized schema design.

## 📄 File Included

- `Project.sql`: Contains SQL scripts for:
  - Creating relational database tables
  - Defining primary and foreign key constraints
  - Inserting sample data
  - Performing SELECT queries, JOINs, filters, aggregations, and more

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- RDBMS: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite *(specify whichever you used)*
- SQL execution tools: MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / DBeaver *(if applicable)*

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design and implement normalized database schema
- Execute data queries to extract meaningful business insights
- Demonstrate use of SQL concepts: 
  - JOINs
  - WHERE clauses
  - GROUP BY / HAVING
  - ORDER BY
  - Subqueries

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
